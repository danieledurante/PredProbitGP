# PredProbitGP: Scalable computation of predictive probabilities in probit models with GP priors

This repository is associated with the article [** Scalable computation of predictive probabilities in probit models with Gaussian process priors**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01471) and aims at providing detailed materials and codes to implement the methods presented in the article.

The documentation is organized in two main parts described below.  

- [`Data and Codes`]().  It contains [i] useful data to reproduce the [`Tutorial.md`]() and [ii] commented source `R` functions in [`Source_code.R`]() to implement the methods presented in the article.

- [`Tutorial.md`](). It contains a detailed tutorial on how to implement the methods and algorithms presented in the article. To accomplish this goal, we reproduce step-by-step the setting `n=250` of the simulation study in the article.

The analyses are performed with **[clarify the computer features]**, using a `R` version **[clarify the R Version]**.
